>Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

# Example 1:
>Input:   nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
>
>Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


# Example 2:
>Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
>
>Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
> 
> Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


# Constraints:
`1 <= nums.length <= 10**5`

`-2**31 <= nums[i] <= 2**31 - 1`

`0 <= k <= 10**5`
