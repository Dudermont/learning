>Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

# Example 1:
>Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
>
>Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
 


# Example 2:
>Input: head = [1,2]
>
>Output: [2, 1]

# Example 3:
>Input: ead = []
>
>Output: []

# Constraints:
`-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
